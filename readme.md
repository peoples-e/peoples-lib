# The People's Library

The People's Library is a decentralized, sharable, syncable media library and web app. 
It's a web app inside a media library and a media libaray inside a web app.

**__ At this point The People's Library is more a proposal than an implementation. __**

## Benefits:

* HTML5 & javascript are open, widely suported and widely accessible
* Decentralized - media files (as well as the app itself) are stored locally and can sync peer-to-peer or via internet
* 100% free & open
* Less Complex - built only on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) allows it to be run on low level devices
* It's all one giant library! 

## Uses

* Seamless Sharing
* Compiling all of the world's content in a giant decentralized database

#### Fun Thoughts

* Closed devices such as Kindles can access People's Libraries via an e-book with a link in it. The built-in browser would load the People's Library e-reader
* Appliances that serve their own manuals & tutorial videos
