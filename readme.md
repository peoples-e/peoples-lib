# The People's Library

The People's Library is a decentralized, sharable, syncable media library and web app. 
It's a web app inside a media library and a media libaray inside a web app.
**__At this point The People's Library is more a proposal than an implementation.__**

## Benefits:

* HTML5 is open and widely suported
* Decentralized - media files (as well as the app itself) are stored locally and can sync peer-to-peer or via internet
* 100% free & open
* It's all one giant library! 

## Uses

* Seamless Sharing
* Compiling all of the world's content in a giant decentralized database
* Appliances that contain their manuals tutorial videos

### Cleverness

* Kindles can access libraries via an e-book with a link in it, so the built-in browser contains the People's Library
