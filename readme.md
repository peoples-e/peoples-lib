# The People's Library

The People's Library is a decentralized, sharable, syncable media library and web app. 
It's a web app inside a media library and a media library inside a web app (i.e. it's a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) [CouchApp](http://couchdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/couchapp/) containing [pouchdb](http://pouchdb.com/)).

**__At this point The People's Library is more a proposal than an implementation.__**

However, [here is a demo](http://owise1.cloudant.com/peoples-lib/_design/peoples-lib/index.html)
