# Thoughts on The People's Library

The People's Library is a couchDB couchApp containing pouchDB. 

## Benefits:

* HTML5 & javascript are open, widely suported and widely accessible
* Decentralized - media files (as well as the app itself) are stored locally and can sync peer-to-peer or via internet
* 100% free & open
* Less Complex - built only on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) allows it to be run on low level devices
* Compiling all of the world's content in a giant decentralized database

## Use Cases

* A user on a desktop PC navigates to a remote peoples-lib via URL.  The user is able to view, search, consume and synch any file in the remote library.  Synched files are stored in the browser for offline use. They can also be downloaded to the PC file system.  The user is also able to see others users who are currently in the library and synch with them peer-to-peer using webRTC
* Guerilla Public Libraries - A raspberry pi or openWRT router running The People's Library is plugged into an out-of-the-way outlet inside a physical public library (or cafe, supermarket, park...).  The device appears as an open wireless access point that allows all connected to view, search, consume and synch (in either direction).
* Seamless Sharing - Two devices containing The People's Library could locate each other and synch automatically.  A Protest organizer might create a library with relevant literature & propaganda allowing protestors to set their libraries to openly synch.

#### Fun Thoughts

* Closed devices such as Kindles can access People's Libraries via an e-book with a link in it. The built-in browser would load the People's Library e-reader
* Appliances that serve their own manuals & tutorial videos
