# Thoughts on The People's Library

![mid-century](/docs/assets/mid-century.jpg "Arts & Architecture")

[Mid-century Modern Design](http://midcenturymoderndesign.tumblr.com/) is an in-depth visual catalogue of the Mid-Century Modern graphic aesthetic. Right now it is hosted for free by Tumblr, a for-profit company owned by Yahoo.  But [as we know](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/1tb/about) free website services (owned by Yahoo) don't always stand the test of time.  So, what if we [made this tumblr into an epub](http://streambooks.thepeoplesebook.net) ([which someone did](http://beta.thepeoplesebook.net/b/streambooks/3eceb1ee7e1f8b99b9c4d13cacee895c) (300+MB)) and added it to our library. Then we could enjoy [Theo Inglis's](http://theoinglis.tumblr.com/) efforts off-line while sharing and conserving it outside the demands of a for-profit environment.  Sounds pretty ok.

You could totally use other programs to package up the Tumblr and then share it via bit torrent.  That would work too.  However, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the images in the meantime.  It wouldn't be _useful_ in the interim.  So it'd be less likely to last.


## Benefits:

* HTML5 & javascript are open, widely suported and widely accessible
* Decentralized - media files (as well as the app itself) are stored locally and can sync peer-to-peer or via internet
* 100% free & open
* Less Complex - built only on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) allows it to be run on low level devices
* Compiling all of the world's content in a giant decentralized database

## Use Cases

![cloud-sync](/docs/assets/cloud-sync.jpg "Cloud Sync")

* A user on a desktop PC navigates to a remote peoples-lib via URL.  The user is able to view, search, consume and sync any files in the remote library.  Synced files are stored in the browser for offline use. They can also be downloaded to the PC file system.  The user is also able to see others users who are currently in the library and sync with them peer-to-peer using webRTC

![public-library](/docs/assets/public-library.jpg "Guerilla Public Library")

* Guerilla Public Libraries - A raspberry pi or openWRT router running The People's Library is plugged into an out-of-the-way outlet inside a physical public library (or cafe, supermarket, park...).  The device appears as an open wireless access point that allows all connected to view, search, consume and sync (in either direction, creating a free & local space for public exchange).

![protest](/docs/assets/protest.jpg "Seamless Sharing")

* Seamless Sharing - Two devices containing The People's Library could locate each other and sync automatically.  A Protest organizer might create a library with relevant literature & propaganda allowing protestors to set their libraries to openly sync.


#### Fun Thoughts

* Closed devices such as Kindles can access People's Libraries via an e-book with a link in it. The built-in browser would load the People's Library e-reader
* Appliances that serve their own manuals & tutorial videos
